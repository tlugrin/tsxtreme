Description: Characterisation of the extremal dependence structure of time series, avoiding pre-processing and filtering as done typically with peaks-over-threshold methods. It uses the conditional approach of Heffernan and Tawn (2004) <DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2004.02050.x> which is very flexible in terms of extremal and asymptotic dependence structures, but requires a stepwise inference approach. Following Lugrin et al. (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s10687-016-0258-0> this package implements a semiparametric Bayesian method to improve efficiency and allow for deriving measures of uncertainty consistently. For example, the package contains a routine to estimate the extremal index, a measure related to the size of clusters of extreme values in time, and this same routine also gives access to the raw samples from the extremal index posterior distribution.
