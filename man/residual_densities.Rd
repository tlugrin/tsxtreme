\title{Compute the residual density/distribution function on a grid of x-values}
\usage{
residual_densities(x, lag, grid)

residual_distributions(x, lag, grid)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a bayesfit object}

\item{lag}{the dimension of the residual density/distribution function to
consider; starts at 1}

\item{grid}{vector of x-values to evaluate the function at}
}
\value{
A list with two elements, x and y, where x is a subset of \code{grid}.
}
\description{
Helper function for plotting the mixture density or distribution function
of the residuals as expressed in the conditional tail model. Given a broad
range of x-values, trims the left and right tails to cover the centre of the
distribution.

only, but exposed to the user as it may prove useful to adjust plots to
different situations. Only minimal checks are performed on the inputs.
